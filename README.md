## Random Length Random Padding Encryption

### Abstract 
This is not a real encryption as the data itself won't be encrypted. The relevant data will be distributed according to a pseudorandomized bitmap. Between these data distribution randomized 'trash' data will be padded making the real data undistinguishable from the padded 'trash' data. This comes with the downside of unnecessary traffic and computational effort in transmission and encryption/decryption.
